# Changelog

All notable user-visible changes will be documented here. HeadBridge follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) once public releases begin.

## Unreleased

- Bowers & Wilkins: discover headphones that advertise over BLE under the
  generic `LE_BWHP` name, hardware-tested with the original Px8.
- Bowers & Wilkins: use the original Px8's ANC mode values, so Off, Noise
  Cancellation, and Pass-Through select the correct mode.
- Bowers & Wilkins: bass and treble sliders for headphones that have a two-band
  tone control instead of the five-band EQ, hardware-tested with the original
  Px8.

## 0.1.7 - 2026-08-16

### First public beta

- Native macOS Sound-style menu with output selection, live volume, and
  `Option`-click input selection.

  and WH-1000XM3.

  provider-specific controls including B&W True Immersion and Sony VPT,
  DSEE HX, sound position, touch sensor, NC optimizer, and sound-quality mode.

  restore-on-connect profiles, Launch at Login, and macOS 26 Control Center
  controls.
- Persistent local per-device battery history and configurable menu-bar
  battery percentage.
